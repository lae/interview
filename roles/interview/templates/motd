Hi {{ interview_realname }}! Welcome to the FireEye Labs Technical Interview!

You'll be doing some relatively trivial problem solving in this session, as
well as answering a couple of questions pertaining to systems administration 
and automation (feel free to use this box to assist you).

You can navigate through the problem sets using "next" to move to the next
question, "previous" to move to the previous question, and "show" to show the
current question. Shortcuts are n, p, and s respectively.

You may also use sudo as necessary. Shortcut to login to a root shell is 'q'.

Please run "screen" and give me a moment to attach to your screen session as
well. You should be doing your work in that screen session.
